line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Triumphal
arches are nothing new when it comes to dedicational architecture, as they
started to pop up in popularity during the Roman empire. These arches were
often built to honor a person or event and normally were architecturally
isolated, but still accessible via a roadway to allow for processions. Though
these pieces of architecture were popular during the Roman period, only three
remain standing today: the Arch of Titus, Arch of Septimius Severus, and Arch
of Constantine, the last of which will be compared to the Arc de Triomphe, a
famous French historical landmark (Triumphal).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The Arch of
Constantine - Arcus Constantini -, which was commissioned by the Roman Senate
in 315 AD at the <i>decennalia</i> - tenth anniversary -<i> </i>of
Constantine’s reign, served to commemorate the victory of the emperor against
Maxentius in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. This battle was
significant as the Romans saw it as a fight for control of their empire in the
west (Arch)sol. The Arch, standing at 20 meters high and 25 meters wide, sits
along the Via Triumphalis, which was and still is a heavily trafficked area
within Rome. This area, known as the Circus Maximus, also houses the Roman
Forum and Flavian Amphitheater, most commonly known as the Colosseum. This
piece of architecture, originally created to commemorate and honor, also serves
as a piece of propaganda for Constantine. It is done through the scenes it
displays and use of <i>spolia </i>from previous emperor’s creations, including
Hadrian, Trajan, and Marcus Aurelius (» Arch). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The second triumphal
arch to be discussed, the Arc de Triomphe (Arc de Triomphe de l’Etoile), was
commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 after his victory in the Battle of Austerlitz,
though it also generally celebrates the victory of French armies. The design of
the arch was modeled after neoclassical pieces, notably Roman, by Jean-François-Thérèse
Chalgrin. Napoleon sought to make his triumphal arch greater and better, which
resulted in a building that is 50 meters tall and 45 meters wide, almost double
the size of the Arch of Constantine. This iconic symbol of French identity took
thirty years to build, with its completion in 1833 and inauguration in 1836 by
the French king, Louis-Philippe (Triumphal). Like the previous Roman arches,
the Arc was built along a heavily trafficked roadway, giving it access to
processions. Many processions have passed along the Arc, such as Germany in
1871 and 1940 and France with their allies in 1918, 1944, and 1945. The area
that the Arc sits on within the roadway allows it to be seen from all twelve
avenues that stem off that main area, forming a star-like formation (<i>etoile</i>)
and giving the Arc its full name: Arch of Triumph of the Star (Triumphal)bas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Triumphal
architecture in general has some common elements that define it. The basic form
consists of two columns connected by an arch and then crowned by a
superstructure, or <i>attica, </i>singular: <i>attic</i>. The <i>attic</i> is
commonly where inscriptions would be carved, detailing the exploits and rights
of the leader. Traditionally, early <i>attica</i> depicted the victor and his
triumphal procession, while later <i>attica</i> depicted solely the emperor. Another
common feature of a triumphal arch is the presence of a cornice, often there is
more than one cornice on an arch, typically one being on the arch and one on
the <i>attic </i>(Triumphal).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Both the Arc
de Triomphe and Arch of Constantine were deliberately placed in their respective
locations, though for different reasons that don’t include being along the way
of a procession. The placement of these arches is done to create an experience
for the viewers when viewing the arches at certain times. The Arch, while situated
near the Flavian Amphitheater, does not rely on that to create a visual
experience but rather a statue that is no longer there: the Colossus of Sol. The
Colossus of Sol, a colossal bronze statue of the sun god, Sol, would have been
centered to have been viewed directly from the central arch. The presence of
the god Sol is a call to the more familiar god to the Romans, Apollo. Both
Augustus and Nero were said to have been under the tutelage of Apollo, so
Constantine’s choice of framing the Arch with this sculpture is not out of
character (Marlowe). Just like the <i>spolia</i> that was used from previous
emperors to partially construct the Arch, Constantine finds a way to use
previous great emperors to legitimize his rule. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            The Arc
utilizes the idea of framing slightly differently and was constructed to be in
line with the setting sun during specific times of the year. It was built
directly along the Historical Axis of Paris, which is set at a 26</span><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Cambria Math",serif'>°</span><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
angle and includes other famous French landmarks. Since being built on this
particular axis, around May 10<sup>th</sup> and August 1<sup>st</sup> every
year, the sun sets along the Historical Axis and therefore directly in the
center of the Arc. Around February 7<sup>th</sup> and November 4<sup>th</sup>
is when the rising sun in the east sets directly under the Arc. Though not
having a direct relationship with any sort of sun god, the Arc can still be
compared to the Arch in that they both frame light and the idea invincibility
and eternity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Inscriptions,
another important element of triumphal arches, are prevalent on both the Arc de
Triomphe and Arch of Constantine. Though both arches have different subject
matter in their inscriptions, they equally serve the same purpose of
commemoration of military victory and legitimization of leaders. The Arch of
Constantine is more classic in its subject matter, detailing the triumphs of
the emperor Constantine. The inscription, on the central part of the <i>attic</i>,
states: “To the Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantinus, the Greatest, pious,
fortunate, the Senate and the people of Rome, by inspiration of divinity and
his own great mind with his righteous arms on both the tyrant and his faction
in one instant in rightful battle he avenged the republic, dedicated this arch
as a memorial to his military victory.” Typical of Roman architecture, this
engraving mentions only the emperor and describes his rule as a divine and
achieved right, especially after beating a ‘tyrant’. This tyrant in question is
Maxentius, who Constantine fought for control over the Roman empire in the
west. The Romans viewed this as a battle against barbarism and their victory
became more meaningful as it had worked to save their society and culture (»
Arch).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Napoleon
takes a more modern route in his choice of inscriptions, and decides to include
the names of 660 soldiers, most of whom were high-ranking generals during the
Napoleonic Wars and French Revolution. Along with the names, several battle
victories from those times in French history are mentioned as well (Pierre). Though
these inscriptions do not mention Napoleon or his leadership directly, viewers
are still aware of his involvement as they are typically French citizens and
are familiar enough with their own history to have the visual literacy to
realize this is a monument to French soldiers and most importantly, Napoleon. With
the recall to himself through a specific choice of inscription, Napoleon is taking
a contemporary approach to naming his achievements. This choice of indirect naming
serves as an act of legitimization and possibly even propaganda as viewers are
reminded of the greatness of Napoleon and his military achievements for the
French people. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            There are
some overlaps in slight details pertaining to the buildings that show how past
pieces can continue to inspire the present in the smallest of ways. Both arches
exhibit similar egg-and-dart molding on the first cornice, right below the <i>attic</i>.
This type of molding is common and is also found on the Erectheion on the
Acropolis in Athens, Greece. The Erectheion was built long before either arch,
again creating a link between motifs and empires. Below the first cornice on
the Arc de Triomphe is yet another tie to ancient architecture, as there is a
row is the Greek Key motif. This is the most common motif in Greek architecture
and is a direct comparison to past great cultures. The Arc and Arch also both
feature winged figures in the spandrels, these figures are carrying victory
trophies. Both figures are female as well, which can be a call to the goddess
of victory, Nike. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
reliefs and designs found on both arches are also important in the message that
is intended for viewers and display similar themes to each other. They depict
scenes that relate to military conquest, though the Arch of Constantine is
older fashioned in that it is specifically about Constantine, whereas the Arc
de Triomphe has metaphorical reliefs and does not depict Napoleon directly. Scenes
found depicted in reliefs on the <i>attic</i> of the Arch of Constantine
include Constantine’s <i>profectio </i>“departure” from Milan, siege of Verona,
Battle of the Milvian Bridge, Constantine’s <i>adventus</i> “arrival” into
Rome, his <i>adlocutio</i> “speech” to the Roman people, and <i>liberalitas </i>“ritual
purification via sacrifice”. This set of scenes found in the reliefs are seen
in order when the viewer walks around the Arch in a clockwise fashion, starting
from the south side. On the west side of the Arch, which is the beginning of
Constantine’s conquest is a moon engraving while on the east side of the Arch,
at the victorious end of the conquest, is the sun. This is directly symbolic of
the state of the Roman empire and Constantine’s role in it, the moon being the dark
period of war and rising sun when Constantine comes back victories after
defeating the tyrant (Elsner). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>All
of the panels featured on the <i>attic</i> show an activity associated with
leadership, such as hunting, public speaking, and offering sacrifices. The <i>adlocutio</i>
and <i>liberalitas</i> are both pieces of spolia from Marcus Aurelius, thought
to have been taken from a previous triumphal arch. The heads of the emperor in
these pieces were later re-carved to depict Constantine (Antonine). This act,
known as <i>damnatio</i> <i>memoriae</i>, is often a derogatory action and is
done to condemn someone, however, Constantine took this as an opportunity to
turn it around and use this combination of techniques as a way to use previous
leaders to legitimize himself. This method is also used in another piece of <i>spolia</i>,
this one from Hadrian. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>One
of the Hadrianic roundels depicts a boar-hunting scene, which has been popular
in leadership art pieces since the Neo-Assyrians. The row of recycled Hadrianic
pieces are surrounded by porphyry, which is purple in color and commonly symbolic
of higher class. Once again, Constantine had decided to re-carve the head of
the emperor, Hadrian, into his own likeness. Like typical triumphal arch
architecture, the Arch of Constantine features columns of the Corinthian order
that frame each smaller arch. These columns are topped by four Dacian captives,
which is a piece of <i>spolia</i> from Trajan. The extensive use of <i>spolia</i>
by Constantine in his commemorative architecture exhibits an urge to use the
past to reinforce the present, and therefore legitimize Constantine as emperor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Though
the Arc de Triomphe does not go to the extent of <i>spolia</i> use that the
Arch of Constantine does, the relief work on the Arc is still notable. The
largest and most popular reliefs are on each of the four bases comprising the
Arc: “The Triumph” by Cortot, “Resistance” by Antoine Étex, “Peace” also by Antoine
Étex, and “The Departure of the Volunteers” or popularly known as “La
Marseillaise” by François Rude. These four reliefs depict events from the
Revolution and First Empire. “The Triumph” features characteristics from Greek
art and society such as the presence of Nike and laurel wreaths. This relief
shows only one figure nude, who more specifically is a woman who has her
genitals covered but chest is bare. Based on traditional Greek depictions of
nude women in art, this woman must be the goddess Aphrodite. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Resistance”
features a more emotionally evoking image as viewers are faced with struggling
civilians who seem to be begging a hero for help, based on the heroic nudity
and drawn weapon of the central male figure. Heroic nudity was a popular characteristic
among the Hellenistic period and is an obvious call to ancient Greece. “Peace”,
another relief done by Étex, features mostly all of the same figures from the
previous relief, “Resistance.” The difference is between the divine figure,
“Peace” features someone who looks quite similar to Athena per her aegis,
staff, and plumed helmet. The worried civilians begging the sword-drawn warrior
are now appeased, the warrior next to them with his weapon sheathed and now
standing in a calm, contrapposto stance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
final and most popular of the reliefs on the base of the Arc is “The Departure
of the Volunteers”, also known as “La Marseillaise”. This relief depicts the
same Athena-looking figure and soldiers, most likely French, preparing to head
into battle as they all have their weapons drawn and are posed seemingly ready
to strike. One figure in particular is in full heroic nudity, featuring the
muscular build and small genitals.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Above
the four base reliefs are bas-reliefs - reliefs that project very little from
the background - that span around the entire Arc. These bas-reliefs depict
events from the Revolution and Napoleonic Era and were carved by various French
artists: “La Bataille d’Aboukir” by Seurre the Elder, “Les Funérailles du General
Marceau” by P.H. Lamaire, “La Bataille de Jemappes” by Carlo Marochetti, “La Prise
d’Alexandrie” by J.E. Chaponnière, “Le Passage du Pont d’Arcole” by FJ.J.
Feuchère, “La Bataille d’Austerlitz” by J.F.T. Gechter. Above these bas-reliefs
is a frieze that depicts soldiers leaving for and returning to battle. Moving
further up the Arc, above the frieze are more dedications to Revolutionary and
Napoleonic War victories (Pierre). </span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Arch of Constantine, constructed to commemorate the victory of the Battle of
the Milvian Bridge, serves as a piece of political propaganda, made with spolia
from the creations of past great emperors like Hadrian, Trajan, and Marcus
Aurelius. Constantine skillfully employs these elements to not only commemorate
his triumph but also to legitimize his rule by associating himself with the
greatness of previous Roman leaders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>On
the other hand, the Arc de Triomphe reflects Napoleon's ambition for grandeur
as it towers over the Arch of Constantine in both size and scale. The
inscriptions on the Arc provide a modern twist to the traditional triumphal
arch inscription subject matter while commemorating French soldiers and
indirectly legitimizing Napoleon's leadership and serving as a form of
propaganda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
reliefs on these arches further aid the leaders in their intentions to
legitimize. The Arch of Constantine, with its scenes of Constantine's conquests
and spolia from previous emperors, showcases a fusion of classical elements.
Meanwhile, the Arc de Triomphe employs reliefs depicting events from the
Revolution and First Empire, reflecting a more metaphorical and collective
representation of French identity.</span></p>
