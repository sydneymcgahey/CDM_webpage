        <h3>My Collection of Notes on Art History in the Ancient Mediterranean</h3>
        <p>The notes found here are ones I have compiled from various classes I have taken at Pitt, and which class each comes from will be specificed on that page. They cover art history/archaeology of the Ancient Mediterranean, though most of my knowledge is on Hellenistic Greece. The notes I'm going to include specifically cover Greece, Rome, the Middle East, and Egypt.</p> 
        <p2>These notes were taken with the intention of the reader already having some background knowledge and therefore are not extensive or thorough. Portions of notes where there is the least information is where I am most knowledgeable, meaning I didn't take many notes as I didn't need to.</p2>
