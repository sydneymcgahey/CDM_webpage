        <p>The Middle East, also called the Near East in art, has art and history that begins even before the first kings of Egypt. This region is where civilization and city-states were born. My notes start all the way back in 4000 BCE with the Uruk period and Third Dynasty of Ur, then goes on to include various groups such as the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Achaemenids. </p>
