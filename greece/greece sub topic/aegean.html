        <p>The early Aegean covers what I like to call "pre-ancient Greece", because this is before Greece became Greece and was just a bunch of regions. Specifically, these notes will cover the early Cyclades, and both the Minoan and Mycenean civilizations. Following this time period are the famous Classical and Hellenistic periods. </p>
