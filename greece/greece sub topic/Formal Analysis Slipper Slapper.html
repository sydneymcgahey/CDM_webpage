<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.9pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>This sculpture group, made
by an unknown Greek sculptor, offers the viewer a very lighthearted scene
rather than the more usual serious ones posed by statues. This trio of mythical
beings dates to around 100 BCE, about two hundred years after the start of the
Hellenistic period. Though the sculpture is a smidge over a couple millennia
old, it is still in relatively good condition. Most old statues have several
pieces missing or broken off but the only evidence of the passage of time is an
arm missing from Eros. This sculpture is carved from Parian marble and stands
at about 4.2 feet tall (1.29 meters), making it a little smaller than
life-size. It is thought to have been carved in Athens but there is also the
possibility that it was created at its origin, the island of Delos. Every part
of it has been carved quite smoothly and the sculpture itself has a smooth and
soft appearance to it. It was found in 1904 on the island of Delos, in the
House of the Poseidoniastai. This sculpture did not travel far and has found
its current home in Exhibition Hall 30 of the National Archaeological Museum in
Athens, Greece, inventory number Г. 3335.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1in;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>The House of the
Poseidoniastai was a private club for merchants traveling through the
Mediterranean, specifically from Beirut. There is an inscription on the base of
the statue: “Διονύσιος Zήνωνος του Θεοδώρου / Bηρύττιος, ευεργέτης, υπέρ εαυτου
/ καί των τέκνων, θεοις πατρώοις”. This inscription translates to: “Dionysios,
son of Zenon and Theodoros, from Beirut, benefactor, dedicated, in favor of
himself and of his children, to the ancestral gods”. Though the exact artist of
this sculpture group is unknown, there is potential that the person – maybe
Dionysios? – who hired the artist is from Beirut, as evidenced by the
inscription on the base. Dionysios was probably a merchant who often visited
the House of the Poseidoniastai during his travels and decided to have this
statue dedicated to bringing some lightheartedness and entertainment to the
club. This would have certainly improved the social standing of Dionysios among
the club because of his philanthropic addition, earning popularity among anyone
who has an appreciation for art and the gods. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>The
statue clearly depicts the Hellenistic style of Rococo, which is similar to the
familiar Baroque, that is the style of many famous sculptures for its immense
detail and large movements portrayed within the art. Rococo is different from
Baroque in that it offers a much more playful and whimsical image of art rather
than something more serious. Rococo often includes satyrs or nymphs, as
evidenced by the inclusion of a horned and hooved figure (Pan). The exact name
is unclear, the piece is usually referenced by simply just listing the
prominent figures shown. With there not being a clear name to the statue, it
has acquired nicknames such as the “Slipper Slapper” or “Sandal Slapper”. The
Slipper Slapper shows three famous figures from Ancient Greek myth: Aphrodite,
Eros, and Pan. Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility. Eros,
the son of Aphrodite and more famously known by his Roman name (Cupid), is
essentially the male version of Aphrodite and is the god of love. Eros is also
known as a primordial god, but other accounts portray him as the son of
Aphrodite, which is the interpretation best suited for the analysis of this
sculpture. Pan, the final figure shown, is a satyr who is also the Greek god of
the wild, rustic music, and inappropriate behavior; he is fairly like Dionysus
regarding what he represents.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            Though
this sculpture is static, the scene depicted is nothing short of dynamic. The
sculptor was able to capture a moment of action as shown by the three figures
all in a different position and reacting to the others. This group gets its
nickname from the action of </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.35pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>Aphrodite, who is attempting to fend off Pan
with the threat of hitting him with her shoe. Upon looking closer, there seems
to be a sandal on one foot, and the “missing” sandal appears to be the one in
Aphrodite’s hand, raised and ready to smack Pan with. Aphrodite’s hair is
pulled back into an up-do, and she is, unsurprisingly of Greek art, naked. Her
smoothly sculpted body is modeled after the average female body of that time
and does not give an unrealistic view on how it should look.  One thing to note
though is that the display of a naked female body was not entirely common until
the 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE, until that point much of the nudity seen was
reserved for heroic men. The nude image was meant to invoke a meaning of power,
so this most likely preliminary presentation of a naked woman, Aphrodite, could
have caught viewers somewhat off guard and drew their attention even more. With
the free hand not poised to strike, Aphrodite is covering her genitalia in
response to Pan and his advances.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            Pan is depicted here acting in a
rather intrusive fashion. He is coming up from behind Aphrodite and it appears
that he is making a sexual advance on her, based on the covering of genitalia.
Pan is shown as fairly muscular in his human torso and detailed in his
animalistic legs. The most detail is on his thighs, where grouped swooping
patterns form the illusion of swirls of fur. His feet are hooved and it seems
there is an extra carved section of the sculpture that acts as a stabilizing
beam for Pan. He is also shown to have a curly beard and hair that is a little
bit unruly. The presence of horns along with the disorderly grooming all
furthermore suggest to the viewer that this man is indeed Pan because of the
wild traits seen and the similarity to barbarianism. Due to the not quite fully
human aspect of Pan, his portion of the sculpture is not quite realistic in
what a man should look like. Despite that, the combination of human and animal
aspects are blended quite well together in this piece and offer a convincing
idea of how exactly a hybrid of these qualities would look. Pan has both of his
hands on Aphrodite, one around her back and the other on the arm covering her
front. The congregation of hands around Aphrodite’s private area leads the eye
there and to how this interaction implies an advance by Pan on the goddess. His
attempt to remove Aphrodite’s hand emphasizes the sexual nature of this
interaction and how it is unwarranted by Aphrodite.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            Eros,
the third figure, is what helps to tie together the elements of Aphrodite and
Pan to help the viewer understand the image and what it is attempting to show.
Eros is seen aiding Aphrodite as he is grabbing Pan by one of the horns on his
head. Compared to the other two figures, Eros is a lot smaller in size. He also
has wings and is flying as he grabs </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>Pan’s horn. Due to his small size, there is
no way that Eros would ever succeed in fending off Pan fully on his own but
that doesn’t seem like the main point. Eros in this sculpture helps to add to
the playful setting that is conveyed, if it were just between Aphrodite and
Eros, then the scene might be more serious. Eros being there is laughable when
the viewer thinks about how Pan tried to make this advance in the presence of
at least one other person. The presence of Eros helps the audience realize the
woman is Aphrodite and vice versa, adding more context for the intended
audience to draw a narrative from.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            This example of Hellenistic
Rococo was meant to be viewed by merchants traveling the Mediterranean, who in
ancient times were pretty much all men. Based on who is present and the
inscription, the viewer is expected to have knowledge of Greek myth and religion
in order to be able to fully take in what the sculptor was trying to portray.
The mostly male audience of this piece of art will have a different view on it
than if the audience were mostly female. Both parties will view this as a
playful piece of art, but women could also see a different meaning that men
might not even consider. This piece centers around sexual advances and the
rejection of said actions in a mischievous manner. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>The
humorousness on the subject can lead to questions on the idea of consent, which
is an issue even to this day. It can give off the impression that sexual
advances and consent are not to be taken entirely seriously, giving the word
“no” a less significant meaning. Pan’s action of physically going after
Aphrodite and putting his hands on her further exemplifies how men do not care
to take women and their agency seriously. Men who view this sculpture will most
likely not take the time to take these things into consideration but rather in
a humorous and boyish way, especially for the period they live in. The ideas
behind consent and inappropriate persistence are not fully formed in the minds
of men and they will simply view this sculpture as its superficial value and
story.  </span></p>
