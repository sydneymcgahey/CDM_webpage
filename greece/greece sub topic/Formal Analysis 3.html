margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'><span lang=EN>Antonio Reder around the
first century BCE. It was excavated from the Theater of </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>Herculaneum in 1761
in Naples, Italy. After a few owners, this statuette found its permanent home
in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, however, it is currently on
loan to the MET for an exhibition on Greek and Roman art. The original statue
that this copy is molded after is a bronze group that Alexander the Great had
commissioned one of his favorite artists, Lysippos, to create (Siano). This is
a miniature version of that statue by Lysippos, measuring about 19.2 inches by
18.5 inches.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            The
original statue stood amongst a group as a monument at Dion on the slopes of
Mount Olympus in Greece. The main reason Alexander had this statue commissioned
was to commemorate the battle at the Granicus (also spelled as Granikos) River
in 334 BCE in Turkey against the Achaemenid Persians. The commission by
Alexander the Great along with the immense detail of the statue means this is
about as Hellenistic as it gets. The battle this commemorates was in 334 BCE
and Alexander the Great died in 323 BCE, so the original had to have been
commissioned sometime in that eleven year period.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>This
piece is made from bronze and silver and instead of being one piece, it is
comprised of four parts. The rider, horse, base, and rudder are all separate
and held together with screws and bolts. With the statuette being made
piecewise, it means that a lot of thought was put into the design. The pieces
would have to be able to fit together once they were cast and screwed to each
other, taking the different textures into place, like the horse’s mane and
Alexander’s skirt (Siano). This copy of Lysippos’s work is renowned for its
attention to detail, especially the armor of Alexander and body of Bucephalus.
Bucephalus’s muscles are captured in a realistic way that makes it look as if
there is no rudder supporting him at all and he is readying to charge forward. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.05pt;
margin-left:36.5pt;line-height:107%'><span lang=EN>Alexander is seen astride
his beloved horse, Bucephalus (also spelled as </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>Boukephalas). The
whole statue is dynamic as both Alexander and his horse are caught in a pose
that might be showing a moment in a battle. This is typical of depictions of
Alexander, as he carefully chooses how to represent himself and only chooses
scenes from battles, hunts, processions, marriages, and pageants. All of these
scenes are not new to art and have commonly been employed to display kings and
their kingship, so of course Alexander had to utilize this visual tactic.
Bucephalus is reared back on his hind legs with his front legs somewhat splayed
out and his expression features an open mouth and wide eyes, seeming like he is
getting ready to jump into battle. Alexander is also in a similar pose of
readiness as evidenced by his turn to potentially face someone and the armor he
is wearing. There is also a scabbard seen on him and his raised right arm
indicates that he was brandishing his sword, ready to strike an enemy.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>Upon original arrival to its
destination, this Roman copy was broken in places and some arms and legs were
missing. These pieces were quickly restored by the Royal Palace of Portici in
Naples in 1762 (Siano). The base supporting Bucephalus was not added until much
later in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. This base supposedly represents the
Granicus River, which could be further be interpreted as Alexander atop
Bucephalus to protect this river and fight off invading armies from it. If the
base does represent the river, the literal support it gives Bucephalus could
also be figurative as well, implying that the river – and therefore the gods –
support Alexander and his fight against the Persians.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            Alexander
the Great is portrayed in his typical fashion: clean shaven, tousled hair, and <i>anastole</i>.
In case if the viewer was unsure of who was atop the horse leading men into
battle, Alexander had to make sure to include his most defining characteristics<i>
</i>when it comes to physical appearances in art. This monument was likely also
used to serve as a means for propaganda for Alexander. In the Battle of
Granicus, the first charge failed and only during the second one was Alexander
the Great successful. Neither Lysippos nor Alexander would be inclined to bring
that up so that fact is omitted, making the statue represent the initial first
charge into battle by a great leader. Despite facing the terror of charging
first into battle, Alexander is shown to have a calm expression. This is
indicative of the confidence and skills that he has and shows the people
looking at this statue that they have nothing to fear. If Alexander can charge
into battle without a trace of fear on his face, then the people under him know
that he will protect them will bravery and come out victorious. It serves to
instill a belief in the people for Alexander and his place as their ruler. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>This
would have also served to remind the viewers of Alexander’s prowess and skills
as a military leader. It would there become just another way Alexander
legitimizes his reign and skills amongst the people of his empire. His use of
propaganda was popular and important when it came to his reign because of the
vast size of his empire. It rivaled other great empires, but Alexander was only
one person, and it was difficult to enact the same amount of control across
different cultures and people. Monuments like this showing Alexander in heroic
moments and exemplifying his excellence help tighten his grip a little bit.
Another way this statue raises Alexander on a pedestal is the fact that he is
on his horse, it brings him up to a higher level both figuratively and
literally.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>This
monument is present on Mount Olympus, which is the famed place of the gods. The
placement of this monument of this infamous mountain could not have been done
by coincidence. Alexander is very purposeful and deliberate when it comes to
his benefactions and commissions, as if art itself required the same amount of
strategy as war. His position upon the mountain close to the gods shows his
divinity and relationship he has with the gods, who will back him and his
continuing claim for legitimization.  </span></p>
