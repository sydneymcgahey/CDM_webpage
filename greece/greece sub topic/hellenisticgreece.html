        <p>The information for the Hellenistic period (323 - 31 BCE) of Greece is a little different. I had taken a class called <b>Alexander and the Hellenistic Age</b>, which is a higher level class. The focus was more on writing and analysis rather than note-taking, which is why I have no notes to provide from this class. However, I do have my essays and decided to include those.</p>
        <p2>The essays I have included are all formal analyses on chosen pieces of Hellenistic work. I do want to note that the first formal analysis listed is quite bad, since it was literally the first formal analysis I wrote. I chose to include it, however, because I still believe it is a good example even to look at.</p2>

        <p2>There are some other classes I've taken that have had short sections on various regions of the Mediterranean, like Greece or Rome. One class, called <b>Art and Empire</b>, explored different empires up to modern times but did have some modules on ancient stuff. Anyway, that class required a comparison paper and formal analysis, the latter which I included.</p2>
