        <p>Both of these sets of notes cover roughly the same time period in Greece, starting with the Geometric and Orientalizing periods. Following the Geometric period, my notes include the Early, High, and Late Classical periods along with the Hellenistic period. The Hellenistic period of the notes is pretty bare bones since at this point in my college career I had already taken a class specifically on this time period.</p>
