margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>This group of small figurines has no name but
still manages to tell a tale of merriment as the women play instruments.
Estimated to have been made sometime between 250 and 225 BCE, these figures
were found on Aegina, an island off the coast of Athens. Details beyond the
date and general location of their excavation are not provided, so the guess on
where these figurines would have exactly been housed during their time could be
extrapolated at best. On Aegina there are two temples that had been standing
during the time of the figurines’ existence, one each dedicated to Apollo and
Athena Aphaia. Aphaia was a goddess who was the daughter of Zeus and Karme. The
Hellenistic period is when there starts to be a decline in the dedication to
polytheism, however, temples and traditional ritual practices were still
popular in Greek society. This idea was most pronounced in the art produced
during this period, which gave the modern world some of the most infamous
sculptures of deities. Since there are two temples on the small island of
Aegina and not much else, there is a fair chance that these figurines could
have originally been from one of them. </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:7.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>Another thing to note since the details of
their finding location are not recorded: there is the possibility that there
are missing figurines from this set, which could potentially change the scene
and how it is interpreted. After an unknown history of these figurines post
original finding, they managed to land themselves into the Department of Greek,
Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities in the Louvre in 1897 from the owner, Galanis.
The group is currently available for viewing at the Louvre in the Sully Wing on
level one, room 646, inventory number CA 799. Each one is nearly ten inches
tall and is carefully molded from reddish-brown molded clay that has then been
finely painted. Every piece also has a vent hole somewhere on it for when it is
fired. Other than a few missing fingers and some of the figurines being pieces
glued back together, this set is in quite good condition and the details of the
figures are preserved well.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:5.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>Of the five figurines, three are standing
while two are seated on small benches. The sitting figures are each accompanied
by a smaller figure. The small figures do not have wings and only one is
depicted as nude so they cannot be <i>erotes</i>. The women that are sitting
with the smaller figures are looking at them as they play, as if they are
somehow involved in the situation. This look could be one of approval but could
also be one of closeness, as if the musician is trying to make a connection
with the person sitting with them. Perhaps they simply are children that are
sitting with the women and listening to them play. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:7.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>Four figurines are holding string instruments
and playing them while a fifth one, which is standing, is not holding a string
instrument but her arms are raised as she is in fact playing something else.
All the instruments being played look like some sort of lyre or kithara, except
for the fifth one that is holding two smaller cylinders. It is hard to tell
exactly what she is holding but it could be a sistrum in each hand, a
traditionally Egyptian instrument that is a type of rattle. This instrument is
commonly used during religious ceremonies. The kithara was typically used by
professional musicians and played during competitions or performances.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:5.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>Each figurine is dressed in clothing that has
been delicately draped over their bodies and the smooth ripples in the clay
make the fabric come to life. This illusion of real fabric is done using a
technique that started in the High Classical period, called “wet drapery.” They
also all have their hair pulled back into some sort of style, some seem to have
a sort of band or flower-looking crown adorning their hair. The way their
curled hair is pulled back into buns is done in a style called melon ribs, to
make the hair look more voluminous and therefore more life-like. Two women even
are shown to have feathered wings which gives an angelic and divine aura. Other
than two of the figurines having wings, each woman is a realistic portrayal of
the typical Greek woman, her looks and form are not idealized. The skin of each
figure has been painted a pink color and their hair was painted with a red
ochre. The paint has since faded away, but the traces were still able to be
identified. Every figurine is delicately carved and full of immense detail as
each one is positioned differently. The women all appear to be in the middle of
dancing and playing music, the seated ones perhaps singing.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:7.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>This group of figurines was most likely
housed in the Temple of Apollo or Temple of Athena Aphaia as dedications to the
gods, also known as <i>anathēmata</i>. Apollo, who is a god of many things but
music being included among those, is likely to have been the one who the
figurines were made for. The combination of human and potentially divine
figures represents a close relationship with the gods, or just god, in this
case. This close relationship would only stem if there was a similarity between
them and the divine, in this case it would be music. These figures in their
temple would have perhaps been used among items of worship, their level of
detail and presence of some winged women bring up the status of the art to that
of something more divine rather than mundane.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:7.55pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'><span lang=EN>Since these pieces are small and easily
handled, they could have been arranged among other offerings in a variety of
scenes that all still show reverence to the gods. Though the symbolism would
remain the same, this offers a more personal approach to worship. Picturing
these figurines among other devotions on an altar within a temple, possibly in
front of a statue, they invoke the feeling of being at a festival and
celebrating via their curved bodies and instruments in hand. This celebration
would most certainly be for the gods, who the Greek society still has not
forgotten about and continues to dedicate art to. </span></p>
