<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            This small terracotta figurine
was found in the Apulia region of Italy, which is across the Adriatic Sea from
Dubrovnik, Croatia. Apart from its finding location, the background of this
piece is not very well documented, however, it managed to find a home at the
Louvre in 1982 in the Department of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities. It
is also currently on view at the museum on the first floor in room 647 of the
Sully Wing, inventory number CA 6824. This piece of work is attributed to an
unknown Greek artist and is thought to have been made between 300 and 275 BCE
during the Hellenistic period.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:2.3pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>Both the female and the
creature behind her are both in quite good condition and even still have some
color on them, with the woman only missing two of her fingers. It appears to
have been broken in several places, but all the pieces have been glued back
together. This piece is not large but bigger than a figurine, measuring 10.6
inches tall, 16.7 inches long, and about 3 inches wide molded from a
yellow-brown type of clay. It is noted that there are two holes present on the
upper tail of the creature in the terracotta, but no specifics are made as to
what these holes are for. There is also no type of design or anything else when
looking at the back of the piece. That fact, along with it being mostly flat in
general, means that it was most likely leaned up against something as a
decorative item. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><span lang=EN>            The female figure represented
here is most likely one of the Nereids. The Nereids are sea nymphs in Greek
mythology and are the fifty daughters of the sea god Nereus and Oceanid Doris.
Though these sea nymphs are not directly correlated to Poseidon in their myth,
they do still hold a familiar relationship with him since both are of the sea.
The two most famous Nereids are Amphitrite, consort of Poseidon, and Thetis,
mother of the infamous Achilles. The Nereids, because of their presence in
oceanic myth, tend to be correlated with Poseidon and can therefore be used as
models of divine worship.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>This unnamed Nereid is shown
wearing a peplos that seems to have been painted red, white, and a dark blue or
purple. The dress can be a peplos because of certain defining features such as
an apoptygma, which is a deep cuff along the neckline, and fibulae, which are
brooch-like pins that hold the garment at the shoulders (Koda). She is also wearing
a sort of crown on her head, which could have been made to look like a crown of
shells and coral. There are remnants of black pigments found along the crown,
which would have made it stand out against the beautiful colors of her dress
and the hippocampus. It looks like the Nereid is also wearing silver earrings
and a necklace with her crown and peplos, this will serve to project her
divinity and beauty over viewers. In addition to wearing items of value, she is
holding a helmet against her side. It can only be assumed that this helmet is
hers and the seahorse behind her is her mount. The helmet itself is quite
plain, which is not out of the ordinary, as it is not the focus of the piece
and serves to help the viewer with their visual literacy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>Along with the probable
Nereid depicted in this figurine, there is also another marine animal that
points toward oceanic worship: the hippocampus. This mythical creature, also
called a sea horse, is a hybrid like many other figures found in Greek myth and
has the upper body of a horse with the lower body of a type of fish. It does
have two front flippers and a long tail with fins that no doubt is to help it
swim quickly through the water. The hippocampus is a direct reference to
Poseidon as it was believed that his chariot was pulled by these creatures,
they were also considered to be mounts for the Nereids as well.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>This creature is in quite
good condition still and has preserved details of the face and mane of the sea
horse very well. On the ridges of the hippocampus’s tail are remnants of either
a red or pink pigment, with the fins being painted what seems to be a dark
blue. The rest of the body has no trace of pigment, so it was most likely left
white. The colors of the hippocampus match nicely with the colors of the
Nereid’s peplos and crown, which helps make the piece more cohesive and show
the relationship between the Nereid and sea creature.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>Upon looking into the region
of Apulia, Italy a little further, there is a temple dedicated to Poseidon
found there. It is in the town of Taranto and known as the Temple of Poseidon,
or Temple Dorique, after its peripteral Doric style of architecture. It is
likely that this terracotta piece could have been housed at this temple for
Poseidon, considering the regional and mythical relationship between Poseidon
and the Nereids. At this point in the ancient Greek world, the Greeks started
to lose their strong ties to their <i>eusebeia</i>, their piety.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>The presence of the gods
didn’t go away overnight, however, and continued to have a role in Greek
culture and society. With the immense popularity among depictions of emotion
with Rococo and Baroque pieces, the Hellenistic Greeks were looking to invoke
emotion within themselves and others. This is why acts such as sacrifices,
prayers, offerings, and other religious practices remained; it allowed the
people to feel a connection. This piece of a Nereid and her hippocampus mount
were most likely part of a dedication, or <i>anathēmata</i>, to the sea god,
Poseidon. Though there are fifty different Nereids that this specific woman
could be, there is a possibility that she is Amphitrite. Amphitrite is one of
the two more popular Nereids, and it would make sense for a divine dedication
to be one that the Greeks are more familiar with. They probably figured it
would be a safe bet to dedicate a figure of Poseidon’s consort rather than
randomly choosing one of her other forty-nine sisters.  This terracotta piece
of a Nereid obviously does not depict Poseidon himself but relies on the visual
literacy of the viewer. By hypothetically choosing to devote a Nereid and
hippocampus to a Temple of Poseidon, this is forcing anyone who sees the piece
to realize the reach of Poseidon. It serves to show the might of the gods and
how they have domain over not only themselves and their power, but other beings
that can have a relationship with their power as well.  </span></p>
