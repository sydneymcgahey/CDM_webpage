<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
carved white marble statue dating back to the second century CE during the
Roman imperial period, depicts three young women standing together in a
dance-like pose. This is a copy of an earlier Greek work, and its dimensions
are about four by three feet. This piece of artwork was originally found in
Rome in 1892, near the Forum of Nerva and Vespasian’s Temple of Peace. Over the
years it has bounced around between owners but has been housed at the MET since
2010.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
three Graces, also known as the Charities, were three daughters of Zeus who
could bestow gifts upon humanity. Gifts they were thought to hold were
fertility, growth, beauty in the arts, and peaceful reciprocity between men.
They were named Thalia, Algaia, and Euphrosyne, each representing abundance,
beauty, and mirth, respectively. The Graces played a role in festivals and
loved to organize dancing but most notably were the personal handmaidens of
Aphrodite, goddess of love, beauty, and fertility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Each
girl is standing shoulder to shoulder in a straight line and alternating in
which ways they face. They are not standing completely upright, each one has a
popped hip and bent knee, each deliberately unevenly shifting their weight.
This method of standing in sculpture first started to appear during the
Classical period starting in 480 BCE and continued to be a staple into the
imperial Roman period several hundred years later. This pose creates more depth
in the sculpture as there are now more curved lines to the body. The new angles
and lines give the eye more to look at than a figure standing rigid. The girls
each have one arm draped over the one adjacent to them in a loose fashion,
elbow hanging over the chest or upper back. The other arm on each figure that
is supposed to be hanging at the side is missing, alongside every head and
neck. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Flanking
each end of the sculpture are some kind of amphorae, both of which have a cloth
draped over the top. Given that all three of the women are naked, it is
possible that the cloth covering the amphorae are their garments. The amphorae
themselves are plain and show no ornamentation. Since the amphorae are not
decorated or in the center, they are obviously not meant to be the focal point
but were intentionally carved, nonetheless. The combination of amphorae and
women in a structured formation could indicate this is a scene from where the
Graces could be found: dancing at a festival.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Arms, heads,
and necks are commonly, almost notoriously, missing from ancient statues and
sculptures. The reason is very simple, and it is this: those places are thinner
and break off easier. As the Graces are handmaidens of Aphrodite, the missing
heads must be beautiful. The Graces’ bodies in the sculpture show that of
young, healthy women with no sort of blemish or scar anywhere to be found. The
combination of youth and health of the women symbolizes their relationship with
divinity. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            In antiquity
when this statue was standing at its prime (having arms and heads), the effect
of it had to have been profound on the viewer. The Graces positioned together
in such a way create this sense of ease and comfort that the viewer doesn’t
want to look away from. The draping of the arms around each other and movement
of the hips is such a subtle change when compared to rigid figures, but the
capture of movement invites the viewer to want to feel that movement
themselves. The viewer gets to feel almost divine as they get to witness the
three Graces dance. The handmaidens to Aphrodite are now acting as bridge
between two worlds, bringing them together: the realm of the gods and the realm
of men. This inclusion of the viewer can make them feel closer to the gods. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Given that the
inspiration for this replica is from ancient Greek times, the feeling of
dancing with higher beings or even more of a sense of closeness could most
likely have been the intended meaning. Being found in an area near a forum and
temple of peace, this sculpture was most likely meant to be seen by the public
who walked through that area. This statue does not seem to be that of
propaganda. Instead of spreading kingly belief and authority, the three Graces fill
out a space where different people converged and offer a positive and
enlightening message.  Greece didn’t have kings or emperors that needed to
communicate their messages and authority, they answered to the gods. This
sculpture does not need to be heavily symbolic or ornate because it is not a
product of imperialism, not technically. It was made during an imperial time by
a subject of imperialism but the item itself lends itself only to older Greek
beliefs. </span></p>
